    "## 5. Define a \"Plausibility Test\" (Scoring Rule)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Thoughts: After building each individually I thought it best to combine \"Printable ASCII ratio\" and \"Letter frequency\". The rationale came down to both of these methods provide a good way to measure the potential candidacy of plaintexts and offering a way to cover one another while being a simiar method of testing. My biggest reason for excluding \"Common word detection\" is that within the current scope I cannot find a reasonable way to normalize the score for it to be worth using. Common words and the percentage of them within a sentence can vary greatly depending on context and topic so having a metric so reliant on this seems unwise. What would be better much like proper brute force methods is have a large dictionary of words (in the case of cracking, top 100,000 most common passwords) to search against and score for how high a ratio of matching words there are, having only common words seems to unreliable. Meanwhile for printable ASCII we can say a ratio as close to 1.0 would be good for english and letter+space would be 0.80-0.90 as again this is the metric expected for the English langauage in writting.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single-byte XOR encryption is extremely vulnerable to brute-force attacks because the range of keys is simply too small. At a single-byte XOR encryption we have a range of 2^8 (0x00 – 0xFF = 256 possible keys) which is small enough to try all keys within a second with most modern computers. So simply try every key.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. As previously mentioned the total range of keys for single-byte is 0x00-0xFF which is 2^8 = 256 total possible keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the brute_force_xor function we run a for loop in range of 256 which allows us to generate and apply each of the keys to the cipher text. Each key is applied to the cipher with a xor with the xor_with_key function. The result of the xor is evaluated with the Scoring Rule that is outlined above.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scoring is necessary since we need a way to be able to effectively parse each of the 256 results because manually checking this many for a human would be prone to error and brain numbing. Meanwhile using a scoring system to find patterns common in the English language would be fairly easy for a machine to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. English plaintext has certain patterns that make it substantially different compared to random plaintext. Of note are the two methods I decided to go with which were \"Printable ASCII ratio\" and \"Letter frequency\". The English language consists of only printable ASCII so if something shows up outside of this we know something is wrong (scores closer to 1 is better but 0.98 to account for indents and newlines). Second the English language consists of 80-90 percent letters and spaces, characters outside of this are only a small ratio in normal english so we want to get a value as close to this range as possible (aiming for 0.85) for simplicity. So a combination of these two scores should closely result in only producing the highest score for something that would closely resemble English which would otherwise be highly unlikely to be the case, especially with the small sample size of 256. This method may fail at larger scales but then may benefit from a dictionary approach outlined in the explaination above.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Random outputs may produce high scores purely out of luck, it is just odds. Since we are not explictly scoring exact English words, this is an outcome that can be expected and more likely with a larger sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Key 0x1d is the top key and it was the correct result. It scored the same as the other top contenders in printable but it scored way higher in the letter+space which is weighted higher since it is a better English metric. We can see it is correct since the preview shows that it is clearly English writting.\n",

    "8. Applying the xor_tool.py to the xor_chal_text.bin with the correct key does result in the same decrypted text file. This would be expected as we know the key so using the previous xor script would provide the same output. \"python3 xor_tool.py decrypt xor_chal_text.bin task1_decrypted.txt 1D\" was used.\n",

    "9. High key entropy is crucial in cryptograph systems. It is painfully highlighted in this lab as with a single-byte xor encryption we were able to brute force crack in less than a second. Meanwhile with proper key entropy it makes brute force cracking unfeasible, either in the time that it would take or the cost for the amount of resources to be able to crack in any kind of reasonable time. It is important to have key entropy that produces an encryption that takes more than its worth to crack. Single-byte is simply not anywhere enough for real life applications.\n",

    "10. For 16 byte key it would then be 16x8=128 bits, then the amount of possible keys would be 2^128 which is equal to 3.4~ e+38. This is an amount of keys which is used by most modern symmetric encryption because to brute force at a rate of a billion keys per second would result in it taking longer than the heat death of the universe. So this would be computationally infeasibile\n",

    "11. No. None of the scoring methods discussed would be able to work properly on binary. It would pass on the printable ASCII but fail on the letter+space. In binary we would not be able to rate it the same as we would for the patterns found in normal characters for English. For this to work we would need to be able to define patterns found in binary that produces English or simply translate the compressed binary into characters but this feels against the heart of the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. While at a glance applying a random encryption to a text file to protect it, unless you understand what type of encryption is being used and why it may just be trival work for a savy actor. The two major parts of note is understanding that XOR encryption is reversible which has potential risk since it uses the same key for encryption and decryption. This would not be an issue if the key is kept secret OR if the range of keys used it not large enough, which was the case here. A single-byte XOR encryption offers no protection against brute force cracking since its key entropy is extremely low."
